Token movement animation has been implemented in the frontend code. The implementation includes:
1. Enhanced EntityToken component with animation support using requestAnimationFrame
2. Position tracking and interpolation in gameStateService.js
3. Animation timing controls in EntityToken.js
4. Grid cell coordinate display for debugging

These changes will allow tokens to smoothly slide between grid cells when they move, rather than teleporting instantly.
